Since 2016, the Beacon protocols is being developed through the ELIXIR Beacon project as a GA4GH driver project. As part of the project, since early 2016 the Computational Cytogenetics and Oncogenomics Group at the University of Zurich develops the Beacon + demonstrator , to demonstrate current functionality and future Beacon protocol extensions. The Beacon + implementation is a custom front end on top of the Progenetix dataset, with emphasis on structural genome variations from cancer samples. On 2020-01-20, Beacon + became part of the ELIXIR Beacon Network . BeaconPlus Data / Query Model \u00b6 The Progenetix / Beaconplus query model utilises the GA4GH core data model for genomic and (biomedical, procedural) queries and data delivery. The GA4GH data model for genomics recommends the use of a principle object hierarchy, consisting of variant (a.k.a. genomicVariation ) a single molecular observation, e.g. a genomic variant observed in the analysis of the DNA from a biosample mostly corresponding to the \"allele\" concept, but with alternate use similar to that in VCF (e.g. CNV are no typical \"allelic variants\") in Progenetix identical variants from different sampleas are identified through a compact digest ( variantInternalId ) and can be used to retrieve those distinct variants (c.f. \"line in VCF\") callset the entirety of all variants, observed in a single experiment on a single sample a callset can be compared to a data column in a VCF variant annotation file callset has an optional position in the object hierarchy, since variants describe biological observations in a biosample biosample a reference to a physical biological specimen on which analyses are performed individual in a typical use a human subject from which the biosample(s) was/were extracted In the Progenetix backend we mirror the GA4GH data model in the storage system, consisting of the corresponding variants callsets (compares to runs + analyses) biosamples individuals collections of MongoDB databases. These collections are addressed by scoped queries. filters Filters / Filtering Terms \u00b6 Filters represent a way to allow the resource provider to direct \"self-scoped\" query values to the corresponding attributes in their backend resource. In the Progenetix implementation, a lookup table followed by scope assignment is used to map prefixed filter values to the correct attributes and collections. Most of the filter options are based on ontology terms or identifiers in CURIE format (e.g. NCIT:C4033 , cellosaurus:CVCL_0030 or PMID:16004614 ). For use case examples please look below; documentation of available ontologies and how to find out about available terms can be found on the Classifications and Ontologies page. In Beacon v2, the new FilteringTerms schema adds options to specify different types of filters ( OntologyFilter , AlphanumericFilter , CustomFilter ) which can contain a number of parameters to define e.g. scope or matching behaviour. These more complex terms are only available through PUT requests. Example \u00b6 \"filters\" : [ { \"id\" : \"NCIT:C4536\" , \"scope\" : \"biosamples\" , \"includeDescendantTerms\" : false } ], Hierarchical Terminologies in Filter Queries \u00b6 Hierarchical terminologies allow queries at different levels, to include all its children terms. The Progenetix query filter system adopts this inclusion logic if the classification / code type is hierarchy-based. However, the includeDescendantTerms pragma can be used to modify this behaviour - globally if provided in a GET request ( &includeDescendantTerms=false ) or as part of filter objects (see above). Examples for codes with hierarchical treatment within the filter space are: NCIt true, deep hierarchical ontology of cancer classifications Cellosaurus derived cell lines are also accessible through the code of their parental line Beacon API \u00b6 Beacon-style JSON responses \u00b6 The Progenetix resource's API utilizes the bycon framework for data query and delivery and represents a custom implementation of the Beacon v2 API. The standard format for JSON responses corresponds to a generic Beacon v2 response, with the meta and response root elements. Depending on the endpoint, the main data will be a list of objects either inside response.results or (mostly) in response.resultSets.results . Additionally, most API responses (e.g. for biosamples or variants) provide access to data using handover objects. Example responses can be genrated through the path examples below. Please be aware that Beacon responses use camelCased parameter names. Beacon v2: Path Examples in Progenetix \u00b6 The Beacon v2 protocol uses a REST path structure for consistant data access. The Beacon+ implementation - developed oin the bycon project implements an expanding set of those Beacon v2 paths for the Progenetix resource. Base / \u00b6 The root path provides the standard BeaconInfoResponse . / Base /filtering_terms \u00b6 /filtering_terms/ \u00b6 /filtering_terms/ /filtering_terms/ + query \u00b6 /filtering_terms/?filters=PMID /filtering_terms/?filters=NCIT,icdom Base /biosamples \u00b6 /biosamples/ + query \u00b6 /biosamples/?filters=cellosaurus:CVCL_0004 this example retrieves all biosamples having an annotation for the Cellosaurus CVCL_0004 identifier (K562) /biosamples/{id}/ \u00b6 /biosamples/pgxbs-kftva5c9/ retrieval of a single biosample /biosamples/{id}/variants/ & /biosamples/{id}/variants_in_sample/ \u00b6 /biosamples/pgxbs-kftva5c9/variants/ /biosamples/pgxbs-kftva5c9/variants_in_sample/ retrieval of all variants from a single biosample currently - and especially since for a mostly CNV containing resource - variants means \"variant instances\" (or as in the early v2 draft variantsInSample ) /biosamples/{id}/analyses/ \u00b6 /biosamples/pgxbs-kftva5c9/analyses/ Base /individuals \u00b6 /individuals/ + query \u00b6 /individuals/?filters=NCIT:C7541 this example retrieves all individuals having an annotation associated with NCIT:C7541 (retinoblastoma) in Progenetix, this particular code will be part of the annotation for the biosample(s) associated with the returned individual /individuals/?filters=PATO:0020001,NCIT:C9291 this query returns information about individuals with an anal carcinoma ( NCIT:C9291 ) and a known male genotypic sex ( PATO:0020001 ) in Progenetix, the information about its sex is associated with the Individual object (and rtherefore in the individuals collection), whereas the information about the cancer type is a property of the Biosample (and therefore stored in the biosamples collection) /individuals/{id}/ \u00b6 /biosamples/pgxind-kftx25hb/ retrieval of a single individual /individuals/{id}/variants/ & /individuals/{id}/variants_in_sample/ \u00b6 /individuals/pgxind-kftx25hb/variants/ /individuals/pgxind-kftx25hb/variants_in_sample/ retrieval of all variants from a single individual currently - and especially since for a mostly CNV containing resource - variants means \"variant instances\" (or as in the early v2 draft variantsInSample ) Base /variants \u00b6 There is currently (April 2021) still some discussion about the implementation and naming of the different types of genomic variant endpoints. Since the Progenetix collections follow a \"variant observations\" principle all variant requests are directed against the local variants collection. If using g_variants or variants_in_sample , those will be treated as aliases. /variants/ + query \u00b6 /variants/?assemblyId=GRCh38&referenceName=17&variantType=DEL&filterLogic=AND&start=7500000&start=7676592&end=7669607&end=7800000 This is an example for a Beacon \"Bracket Query\" which will return focal deletions in the TP53 locus (by position). /variants/{id}/ or /variants_in_sample/{id} or /g_variants/{id}/ \u00b6 /variants/5f5a35586b8c1d6d377b77f6/ /variants_in_sample/5f5a35586b8c1d6d377b77f6/ /variants/{id}/biosamples/ & variants_in_sample/{id}/biosamples/ \u00b6 /variants/5f5a35586b8c1d6d377b77f6/biosamples/ /variants_in_sample/5f5a35586b8c1d6d377b77f6/biosamples/ Base /analyses (or /callsets ) \u00b6 The Beacon v2 /analyses endpoint accesses the Progenetix callsets collection documents, i.e. information about the genomic variants derived from a single analysis. In Progenetix the main use of these documents is the storage of e.g. CNV statistics or binned genome calls. /analyses/ + query \u00b6 /analyses/?filters=cellosaurus:CVCL_0004 this example retrieves all biosamples having an annotation for the Cellosaurus CVCL_0004 identifier (K562) bycon Beacon Server \u00b6 The bycon project provides a combination of a Beacon-protocol based API with additional API services, used as backend and middleware for the Progenetix resource. bycon has been developed to support Beacon protocol development following earlier implementations of Beacon+ (\"beaconPlus\") with now deprected Perl libraries.

As part of the ELIXIR h-CNV community and contributors to the GA4GH Beacon project and Variant Representation Specification (VRS) we have co-developed a \"CNV assessment ontology\" which in January 2022 has been accepted into the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) and is under discussion at Sequence Ontology (SO) and for use in VRS.

As the name implies, SVG is scalable , i.e. images can be scaled up without loosing quality or expanding in storage size. However, some of teh generated images use also embedded rastered components which will deteriorate during scaling - this is e.g. the case for array probe plots. !!! note Wikipedia All major modern web browsers\u2014including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, and Microsoft Edge\u2014have SVG rendering support. On most pages where plots are being displayed there is a download option for the images - (please alert us where those are missing). Browsers also have the option to export SVGs themselves e.g. as PDF. The PGX plotting library \u00b6 Plots on Progenetix are generated using the PGX package , a set of Perl libraries for processing and graphical representation of CNV data. The package contains tools to read and write e.g. Progentix segment files generate binned status maps render plots of sample-specific and aggregate CNV data, such as histograms and CNV frequency heatmaps CNV Histogram Plots \u00b6 There are two possibilities to plot CNV histograms through the Progenetix API w/o using the user interface: direct visualization of pre-computed collations, e.g. publications or diagnosttic entities progenetix.org/cgi/PGX/cgi/collationPlots.cgi?datasetIds=progenetix&id=NCIT:C4443 a Beacon API query with the added option &output=histoplot progenetix.org/beacon/biosamples/?limit=200&datasetIds=progenetix&referenceName=refseq:NC_000009.12&variantType=EFO:0030067&start=21500000,21975098&end=21967753,22500000&filters=NCIT:C3058&output=histoplot Please use option 1 if accessing complete entities (i.e. only using a single filters value) - this option is not limited through large sample numbers. Services \u00b6 Cancer Genomics Publications publications \u00b6 The publications service serves as backend API for the display of genome screening publications through the Progenetix Publications DB . It provides articles describing whole genome screening (WGS, WES, aCGH, cCGH) experiments in cancer, including some information about e.g. the numbers of samples analysed with a given technology and if sample profiles are available in Progenetix. Please contact us to alert us about additional articles you are aware of. The inclusion criteria are described in the documentation . Since 2021 you can now directly submit suggestions for matching publications to the oncopubs repository on Github . Cytoband Mapping cytomapper \u00b6 This services parses either: a properly formatted cytoband annotation ( cytoBands ) \"8\", \"9p11q21\", \"8q\", \"1p12qter\" a concatenated chroBases parameter 7:23028447-45000000 X:99202660 While the return object is JSON by default, specifying text=1 , together with the cytoBands or chroBases parameter will return the text version.

Binned genome CNV values are available for all individual analyses (genome profiles), indicating the interval's involvement in one or more CNV events, separated for gains and losses. Additionally, for all all collations (e.g. profiles of a tumor type, or from the same publication), pre-computed interval CNV frequencies are available Alternatively, interval frequency maps can be generated on the fly from e.g. search results. The binning does not apply to the variant data itself; i.e. genomic variants are stored and being queried with their original parameters. Binning Procedure \u00b6 Binned CNV mappings are generated through utility functions in the bycon package: a standard set of 1Mb genomic intervals (0-based interbase coordinates) is generated (with the last bands at pter and qter potentially differing in size) using coordinates from the current (GRCh38) cytoband mapping file for each analysis/callset, all its CNV variants are collected and for each of the (currently 3106) intervals the sum of variant intersections is used to calculate the overlap fraction, for gains and losses separately (accommodating for the smaller sizes of q-telomeric bins) additionally, the maximum and minimum CNV values (log2) are stored for each bin As a result, all samples have now 2x3106 values for gain and loss overlap fractions as well as - for samples with accessible original data - relative CNV intensities. Frequency Maps \u00b6 CNV frequencies are calculated for collations, or samples from search results, by counting the occurrences of non-zero status values for all given intervals in the selected samples, with an optional filter for a minimal fraction.

For the clustering of both status and frequency values, gain and loss intervals are treated independently, resulting in 6212 1 values per sample (or collation) for the generation of a clustering matrix: for sample clustering, the cluster matrix for each sample (line) consists of the fraction of each 1Mb bin covered by a gain (resp. loss) in this sample this results for CNVs larger than 1Mb in several bins with 1.000 , and then the edge bins with values below 1 for CNV frequencies (e.g. comparing results for different cancer types) the values are the percents of samples having a CNV of the given type per 1Mb bin On the website sample and/or collation clustering is involved automatically on the \"Data Visualization\" page which can be accessed from the search results. Clustering as well as CNV visualization are performed through the PGX Perl library, utilizing the Algorithm::Cluster interface to the C cluster library with default parameters: m : pairwise complete-linkage clustering e : Euclidean distance For visualization, while clustering is performed on the matrix with separate values for gains and losses, the plotting is then performed on the original data: samples are ordered as determined from the clustering, but then the original non-binned CNV segments are plotted along the genome this results in the natural sequence of gain and loss segments, not in a separate display for CNV frequencies, a mixed color is generated fro the combined gain and loss values for each 1Mb bin technically, each of the red, green, blue channels of the RGB values for the gain and loss frequencies the channel values for DUP and DEL are added, normalized for the overall maximum CNV frequency in the data for my $i ( 0 .. 2 ) { $dupRGB -> [ $i ] = int ( $dupRGB -> [ $i ] * $dupF / $maxF ); $delRGB -> [ $i ] = int ( $delRGB -> [ $i ] * $delF / $maxF ); if (( $dupRGB -> [ $i ] + $delRGB -> [ $i ]) < 255 ) { $RGB [ $i ] = $dupRGB -> [ $i ] + $delRGB -> [ $i ] } else { $RGB [ $i ] = 255 } } Clustering can be omitted by setting Cluster Tree Width to 0 .

Traditionally, the relevance of somatic CNVs hitting a gene in the context of cancer are judged by the CNV frequency (i.e. in what fraction of samples the a CNV in this gene is being observed) the relative specificity, i.e. how CNVs in this gene compare to the overall amount of CNVs in the samples the local specificity, i.e. the \"focality\" of the CNVs The Progenetix Search Page supports the exploration of regional CNVs through support for inserting positions of genes or cytobands into standard Beacon query parameter fields selection support for hierarchical disease annotations providing example queries as templates The response of the queries for genomic variants provide some basic statistics, e.g. the relative frequencies of these variants for each classification code (e.g. NCIT, ICD-O) encountered in teh matched samples. Example Procedure \u00b6 TBD Visualize CNV patterns \u00b6 The Progenetix resource contains pre-computed CNV frequency profiles for all diagnostic and technical (e.g. derived from a publication or technical platform) categories. These profiles provide a rapid overview of CNV events along the genome but also can serve for the exploration of possible genomic subsets hidden behind the overview profiles. CNV profile clustering \u00b6 Example Procedure \u00b6 TBD Download or Plot CNV Frequencies \u00b6 Collation plots \u00b6 The Progenetix resource provides pre-computed CNV frequencies for all its \"collations\" such as cancer types by e.g. NCIt, ICD-O morphology and topography codes experimental series, e.g. all samples from a given publication custom cohorts, e.g. all samples used in a Progenetix meta-analysis or external project such as TCGA This data can be accessed through the Progenetix API in data and image format. Interval frequencies are per default stored in a 1Mb binned format. More information about the API use can be found in the IntervalFrequencies API documentation . Query-based histograms \u00b6 The Progenetix Beacon responses - depending on their type - usually contain a handover URL to retrieve CNV histogram and/or sample plots of the samples matched by the query. The bycon API now offers a direct access to the histograms without the need to deparse JSON response first. The switch to the histogram is ionitiated by adding &output=histoplot to the Beacon query URL. Then, the API will first query the samples and then perfor a handover to the plotting API. Please be aware that this procedure is best suited for limited queries and may lead to a time-out.

Now, the last interval of the short arm of any chromosome is terminated at the centromere, leading to a (potentially) shortened \"last p\" interval a shift of most interval positions a changed interval number from 3102 to 3106 Also, since a few qter intervals were very small we now use a padding factor (currently 100000 bases) to determine if the last band would be smaller - in which case it is discarded and the previous interval extended to cover up to the telomere. This applies to chromosomes 6 and X, where the last intervals become now slightly larger than 1Mb: X:155000000-156040895, size 1040895 6:169800000-170805979, size 1005979 Since many CNVs have natural breakpoints at chromosomal centromeres the new interval mapping should provide a better representation of genomic events.

While specific CNV events and some recurring patterns have contributed to the identification of individual cancer drivers and the recognition of cancer subtypes, the complexity of genomic CNV patterns requires large amounts of well-defined genomic profiles for statistically meaningful analyses. At the other end of the spectrum, in the area of rare disease genomics the potential pathogenicity of individual CNV events requires validation against a vast set of disease-related and reference genomic profiles and annotations. Methods The \u201cBeacon\u201d protocol - developed with support from ELIXIR, the European bioinformatics infrastructure organization, as a standard of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) - represents an emerging standard for an \u201cInternet for Genomics\u201d. While the initial version of the protocol served as a widely adopted test bed for the sharing of genomic variants over federated query systems connecting hundreds of internationally distributed resources, the version 2 of the protocol aims at providing a framework for extended, metadata-rich query and response options in both public and restricted federated access scenarios. Throughout the development of Beacon v2, the Progenetix cancer genomics resource (progenetix.org) - including the largest publicly accessible set of cancer CNV data - has served as a testbed for implementation of Beacon v2 protocol features. Results With the implementation of the Beacon v2 API as backbone of the Progenetix resource - serving genome-wide CNV profiling data from more than 130\u2019000 individual experiments, representing over 700 diagnostic entities and more that 1\u2019500 published studies - we could demonstrate the use of the GA4GH Beacon v2 protocol as a practical solution for the sharing of vast amounts of genomic profiling data, in a open setting and using a documented, completely open API for third party use. Conclusion: With the Beacon v2 protocol - as a major upgrade from the v1 standard - currently being under review as GA4GH standard, work is focussing on its implementation in a wide set of use cases, from access protected clinical information systems to public-access research databases. Importantly, an ELIXIR-supported implementation study by members of the ELIXIR h-CNV community (cnvar.org) will explore the generation of Beacon v2 powered CNV implementations by various major European genomics resources, in the fields of human genetics / rare diseases and cancer genomics.

METHODS: Of the 15429 cases collected for the Progenetix molecular-cytogenetic database, 5918 malignant epithelial neoplasias analyzed by chromosomal Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) were selected for further evaluation. For the 22 clinico-pathological entities with more than 50 cases, summary profiles for genomic imbalances were generated from case specific data and analyzed. RESULTS: With large variation in overall genomic instability, recurring genomic gains and losses were prominent. Most entities showed frequent gains involving 8q2, while gains on 20q, 1q, 3q, 5p, 7q and 17q were frequent in different entities. Loss \"hot spots\" included 3p, 4q, 13q, 17p and 18q among others. Related average imbalance patterns were found for clinically distinct entities, e.g. hepatocellular carcinomas (ca.) and ductal breast ca., as well as for histologically related entities (squamous cell ca. of different sites). CONCLUSION: Although considerable case-by-case variation of genomic profiles can be found by CGH in epithelial malignancies, a limited set of variously combined chromosomal imbalances may be typical for carcinogenesis. Focus on the respective regions should aid in target gene detection and pathway deduction.","title":"Genomic imbalances in 5918 malignant tumors"},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2007-01-01-publication-Genomic-imbalances/#genomic-imbalances-in-5918-malignant-epithelial-tumors-an-explorative-meta-analysis-of-chromosomal-cgh-data","text":"","title":"Genomic imbalances in 5918 malignant epithelial tumors: an explorative meta-analysis of chromosomal CGH data."},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2012-04-02-compbio-arraymap-feature-updates/","tags":["recovered","news","arraymap"],"text":"arrayMap feature update(s) \u00b6 Over the last weeks, we have introduced a number of new search/ordering features to arrayMap.

This could provide an alternative paradigm in cancer development, replacing the gradual accumulation of genomic changes with a \"one-off\" catastrophic event. However, the term has been used with varying operational definitions, with the minimal consensus being a large number of locally clustered copy number aberrations. The mechanisms underlying these chromothripsis-like patterns (CTLP) and their specific impact on tumorigenesis are still poorly understood.

Fragmentation hotspots were found to be located on chromosome 8, 11, 12 and 17. Among the various cancer types, soft-tissue tumors exhibited particularly high CTLP frequencies. Genomic context analysis revealed that CTLP rearrangements frequently occurred in genomes that additionally harbored multiple copy number aberrations (CNAs). An investigation into the affected chromosomal regions showed a large proportion of arm-level pulverization and telomere related events, which would be compatible to a number of underlying mechanisms. We also report evidence that these genomic events may be correlated with patient age, stage and survival rate. CONCLUSIONS: Through a large-scale analysis of oncogenomic array data sets, this study characterized features associated with genomic aberrations patterns, compatible to the spectrum of \"chromothripsis\"-definitions as previously used. While quantifying clustered genomic copy number aberrations in cancer samples, our data indicates an underlying biological heterogeneity behind these chromothripsis-like patterns, beyond a well defined \"chromthripsis\" phenomenon.","title":"Chromothripsis-like..."},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2014-01-01-Chromothripsis-like/#chromothripsis-like-patterns-are-recurring-but-heterogeneously-distributed-features-in-a-survey-of-22347-cancer-genome-screens","text":"","title":"Chromothripsis-like patterns are recurring but heterogeneously distributed features in a survey of 22,347 cancer genome screens."},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2014-01-01-Progenetix-12-years/","tags":["article"],"text":"Progenetix: 12 years of oncogenomic data curation. \u00b6 Cai H, Kumar N, Ai N, Gupta S, Rath P, Baudis M. \u00b6 Abstract DNA copy number aberrations (CNAs) can be found in the majority of cancer genomes and are crucial for understanding the potential mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression.

While germline CNVs are a major contributor to genomic syndromes and inherited diseases, the majority of cancers accumulate extensive \u201csomatic\u201d CNV (sCNV or CNA) during the process of oncogenetic transformation and progression. While specific sCNV have closely been associated with tumorigenesis, intriguingly many neoplasias exhibit recurrent sCNV patterns beyond the involvement of a few cancer driver genes. Currently, CNV profiles of tumor samples are generated using genomic micro-arrays or high-throughput DNA sequencing. Regardless of the underlying technology, genomic copy number data is derived from the relative assessment and integration of multiple signals, with the data generation process being prone to contamination from several sources. Estimated copy number values have no absolute and linear correlation to their corresponding DNA levels, and the extent of deviation differs between sample profiles which poses a great challenge for data integration and comparison in large scale genome analysis. In this study, we present a novel method named Minimum Error Calibration and Normalization of Copy Numbers Analysis (Mecan4CNA). For each sCNV profile, Mecan4CNA reduces the noise level, calculates values representing the normal DNA copies (baseline) and the change of one copy (level distance), and finally normalizes all values. Experiments of Mecan4CNA on simulated data showed an overall accuracy of 93% and 91% in determining the baseline and level distance, respectively. Comparison of baseline and level distance estimation with existing methods and karyotyping data on the NCI-60 tumor cell line produced coherent results.

Studies disentangling the contributing factors may help in both understanding cancer biology and tailoring therapeutic interventions. Ancestry estimation in such studies should preferably be driven by genomic data, due to frequently missing or erroneous self-reported or inferred metadata. While respective algorithms have been demonstrated for baseline genomes, such a strategy has not been shown for cancer genomes carrying a substantial somatic mutation load. We have developed a bioinformatics tool for the assignment of population groups from genome profiling data for both unaltered and cancer genomes. Despite extensive somatic mutations in the cancer genomes, consistency between germline and cancer data reached of 97% and 92% for assignment into 5 and 26 ancestral groups, respectively.

Due to the heterogeneity of cancers, precise information about the genomic composition of germline and malignant tissues has to be correlated with morphological, clinical and extrinsic features to advance medical knowledge and treatment options. With global differences in cancer frequencies and disease types, geographic data is of importance to understand the interplay between genetic ancestry and environmental influence in cancer incidence, progression and treatment outcome. In this study, we analyzed the current landscape of oncogenomic screening publications for geographic information content and quality, to address underrepresented study populations and thereby to fill prominent gaps in our understanding of interactions between somatic variations, population genetics and environmental factors in oncogenesis. We conclude that while the use of proxy-derived geographic annotations can be useful for coarse-grained associations, the study of geo-correlated factors in cancer causation and progression will benefit from standardized geographic provenance annotations. Additionally, publication-derived geographic provenance data allowed us to highlight stark inequality in the geographies of cancer genome profiling, with a near lack of sizable studies from Africa and other large regions.","title":"Geographic assessment of cancer genome profiling studies"},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2020-04-02-publication-geography-assesment-DATABASE/#geographic-assessment-of-cancer-genome-profiling-studies","text":"","title":"Geographic assessment of cancer genome profiling studies."},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2020-05-07-publication-Mecan4CNA-Genomics/","tags":["article"],"text":"Minimum Error Calibration and Normalization for Genomic Copy Number Analysis. \u00b6 Bo Gao and Michael Baudis (2020) \u00b6 bioRxiv, 2019-07-31.

In the past three decades, a vast amount of CNA data has been generated by molecular-cytogenetic and genome sequencing based methods. While this data has been instrumental in the identification of cancer-related genes and promoted research into the relation between CNA and histo-pathologically defined cancer types, the heterogeneity of source data and derived CNV profiles pose great challenges for data integration and comparative analysis. Furthermore, a majority of existing studies has been focused on the association of CNA to pre-selected \"driver\" genes with limited application to rare drivers and other genomic elements. In this study, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline to integrate a collection of 44,988 high-quality CNA profiles of high diversity. Using a hybrid model of neural networks and attention algorithm, we generated the CNA signatures of 31 cancer subtypes, depicting the uniqueness of their respective CNA landscapes. Finally, we constructed a multi-label classifier to identify the cancer type and the organ of origin from copy number profiling data. The investigation of the signatures suggested common patterns, not only of physiologically related cancer types but also of clinico-pathologically distant cancer types such as different cancers originating from the neural crest. Further experiments of classification models confirmed the effectiveness of the signatures in distinguishing different cancer types and demonstrated their potential in tumor classification.","title":"Genomic Copy Number Signatures..."},{"location":"news/2001-2020/2020-12-18-publication-Bo-classifiers/#genomic-copy-number-signatures-based-classifiers-for-subtype-identification-in-cancer","text":"","title":"Genomic Copy Number Signatures Based Classifiers for Subtype Identification in Cancer"},{"location":"news/2021/2021-01-04-website-biosample-table-mods/","text":"The new year brings some refinements to biosamples search and display: added example for a pure filter search (HeLa) made UCSC link depending on variants added info pop-ups to biosamples table header removed DEL and DUP fractions from biosamples table added label display for external_references items in biosamples table Enjoy ...","title":"Website updates"},{"location":"news/2021/2021-01-14-LOH-data/","text":"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is a phenomenon frequently observed in cancer genomes where the selective pressure to keep only the susceptible gene product from one allele removes the other healthy allele from the pool; In this context, copy neutral - loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) is commonly observed in haematological malignancies (O'keefe et al., 2010 and Mulligan et al., 2007).

Notes and procedure of the data import and transformation: - In principle, DIPG IDs are treated as individual level, so multiple biosamples can belong to same DIPG ID (e.g. normal v.s. tumor). - When merging multiple individuals (resp. biosamples) into the one individual (resp. biosamples), a new entry is created and the old ones are deleted, but their ids as well as their \"info.legacy_id\"s are kept in the new entry's \"info.legacy_id\". - for part 1, we have mapped the GEO metadata to the DIPG ids, including separation of normals and tumors. The dipg ids in the form of \"DIPG_BS_xxxx\"(numbering from 0001 to 1067) as well as its respective GSM IDs are dropped into \"info.legacy_id\" when generating a timestamp id. - for part 2, where dipg ids were not already present in progenetix, we have imported the data from \"dipg db\", with fields in the \"variants\" collection adapted to the current data schema. - the DIPG cohort contributed 1067 individuals, 1108 biosamples, 900 callsets and 3009676 variants.","title":"Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG) cohort"},{"location":"news/2021/2021-02-22-gene-symbol-queries/","text":"We have introduced a simple option to search directly by Gene Symbol, which will match to any genomic variant with partial overlap to the specified gene. This works by expanding the Gene Symbol (e.g. TP53 , CDKN2A ...) into a range query for its genomic coordinates (maximum CDR). Such queries - which would e.g. return all whole-chromosome CNV events covering the gene of interest, too - should be narrowed by providing e.g. Variant Type and Maximum Size (e.g. 2000000) values. For testing we have provided a dedicated search form which allows you to test the search for variants by gene symbol and size thresholding. The options may be expanded, e.g. for categorical overlap definitions or range expansions. Please remember that all these searches can be implemented by standard range requests - and even more fine tuned with \"bracketed\" searches as in the CNV Request example for Beacon+ .","title":"Beacon+ and Progenetix Queries by Gene Symbol"},{"location":"news/2021/2021-04-15-publication-Bo-classifiers/","text":"Bo Gao and Michael Baudis (2021) \u00b6 Accepted at Frontiers in Genetics , 2021-04-15 \u00b6 Abstract \u00b6 Copy number aberrations (CNA) are one of the most important classes of genomic mutations relatedto oncogenetic effects. In the past three decades, a vast amount of CNA data has been generated bymolecular-cytogenetic and genome sequencing based methods. While this data has been instrumentalin the identification of cancer-related genes and promoted research into the relation between CNA andhisto-pathologically defined cancer types, the heterogeneity of source data and derived CNV profilespose great challenges for data integration and comparative analysis. Furthermore, a majority of exist-ing studies have been focused on the association of CNA to pre-selected \u201ddriver\u201d genes with limitedapplication to rare drivers and other genomic elements. In this study, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to integrate a collection of 44,988 high-qualityCNA profiles of high diversity. Using a hybrid model of neural networks and attention algorithm, wegenerated the CNA signatures of 31 cancer subtypes, depicting the uniqueness of their respective CNAlandscapes. Finally, we constructed a multi-label classifier to identify the cancer type and the organ oforigin from copy number profiling data. The investigation of the signatures suggested common patterns,not only of physiologically related cancer types but also of clinico-pathologically distant cancer typessuch as different cancers originating from the neural crest. Further experiments of classification modelsconfirmed the effectiveness of the signatures in distinguishing different cancer types and demonstratedtheir potential in tumor classification.

Abstract \u00b6 In cancer, copy number aberrations (CNAs) represent a type of nearly ubiquitous and frequently extensive structural genome variations. To disentangle the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis as well as identify and characterize molecular subtypes, the comparative and meta-analysis of large genomic variant collections can be of immense importance. Over the last decades, cancer genomic profiling projects have resulted in a large amount of somatic genome variation profiles, however segregated in a multitude of individual studies and datasets. The Progenetix project, initiated in 2001, curates individual cancer CNA profiles and associated metadata from published oncogenomic studies and data repositories with the aim to empower integrative analyses spanning all different cancer biologies. During the last few years, the fields of genomics and cancer research have seen significant advancement in terms of molecular genetics technology, disease concepts, data standard harmonization as well as data availability, in an increasingly structured and systematic manner. For the Progenetix resource, continuous data integration, curation and maintenance have resulted in the most comprehensive representation of cancer genome CNA profiling data with 138 663 (including 115 357 tumor) copy number variation (CNV) profiles. In this article, we report a 4.5-fold increase in sample number since 2013, improvements in data quality, ontology representation with a CNV landscape summary over 51 distinctive National Cancer Institute Thesaurus cancer terms as well as updates in database schemas, and data access including new web front-end and programmatic data access.
